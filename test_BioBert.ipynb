      " A promising new cancer therapy also appears extremely potent against one of the world's most devastating infectious diseases: tuberculosis (TB).Scientists at Texas Biomedical Research Institute (Texas Biomed) found the therapy dramatically reduces TB growth, even for bacteria that are drug-resistant. The findings, reported in the journal Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, were made in novel cellular models featuring TB-infected human cells that can help accelerate screening of potential TB drugs and therapies like this one.The therapy evaluated in this study combines two molecules – one of which is already FDA-approved for use in cancer patients, and another that is being evaluated in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for cancer. The compounds help the body initiate its normal cell death processes in targeted areas, be it cancerous cells, or in this case, cells infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the bacteria that causes TB.\n"

      " Transcription factors play essential roles in turning the genetic information encoded in genes into proteins in all cells and organisms. These regulatory proteins bind DNA, turn genes on or off, and control the rate at which DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is needed for protein synthesis. Because of their central role in transcriptional control, many diseases can be traced back to dysregulated transcription factors. Inhibiting their activity, especially in cancer, offers therapeutic potential, but many transcription factors have a trick up their sleeve. Their activation domains are intrinsically disordered, meaning that the chains of amino acids that make up the domain lack a clear three-dimensional structure. The lack of a stable 3D structure makes it virtually impossible to design drugs that bind to activation domains.\n"

To understand how a preference for social interactions is encoded, we used in vivo calcium imaging to compare medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity in female wild-type and Mecp2-heterozygous mice during three-chamber tests. We found that mPFC pyramidal neurons in Mecp2-deficient mice are hypo-responsive to both social and nonsocial stimuli. Hypothesizing that this limited dynamic range restricts the circuit’s ability to disambiguate coactivity patterns for different stimuli, we suppressed the mPFC in wild-type mice and found that this eliminated both pattern decorrelation and social preference. Conversely, stimulating the mPFC in MeCP2-deficient mice restored social preference, but only if it was sufficient to restore pattern decorrelation. \n"

E.g., it is informative in neuron science studies to build the connection between experiment animals' neuron activity images and their behavior images. Very few previous works have achieved this task since most generative models focus on reconstructing the output images similar to input images. We proposed a novel framework in this paper to accomplish this goal, which could map images from one group to images from another group. We apply the singular value decomposition (SVD) method to remove the original images' background noise. Next, we combine two deep learning approaches, variational autoencoder (VAE) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to directly connect two groups of images.

      " The prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuit plays a central role in processing social information. PFC dysfunction has been demonstrated in many autism-associated disorders, including Rett syndrome (RTT), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. The prelimbic PFC is hypoactive in RTT, but the precise mechanisms underlying the social avoidance remain obscure. Here we studied MeCP2-deficient mice, using in vivo calcium imaging to record neuronal activities in the prelimbic medial PFC (mPFC) while mice chose whether to interact with an object or a fellow mouse. We found that prelimbic mPFC hypoactivity restricts the responsiveness of the circuit and limits its ability to decorrelate patterns encoding social and nonsocial stimuli. Optogenetic stimulation of the prelimbic circuit throughout the social interaction restored pattern discrimination and social interactivity. This work shows that what appears to be social avoidance is actually an inability to discriminate social from nonsocial cues.\n"

      " Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in various tasks. However, DNNs expose uncertainty and unreliability against well-designed adversarial examples, thus leading to misclassification. Accordingly, a collection of methods have been proposed to improve the robustness of DNNs by detecting adversarial attacks. In this paper, we combine model explanation techniques and adversarial models, aiming to improve adversarial detection in real-world scenarios. Specifically, we develop a novel adversary-resistant detection framework called EXPLAINER by utilizing the interpretation results extracted from explainable learning models. The explanation model in EXPLAINER produces an explanation map identifying the relevance of input variables in the model’s classification result. consequently, the adversarial example can be effectively detected by comparing the explanation results of a given sample and its denoised version, without referring to any prior knowledge of attacks. The proposed framework is thoroughly evaluated on different adversarial attacks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves promising results in white-box attacks.\n"
